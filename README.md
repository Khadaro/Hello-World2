# Hello World

> Description the project.

In this project, I have set up a "Hello world" repository. My tasks include:

 Documented a professional README.md.
 Created a new branch according to the GitHub flow rules.
 Included a .gitignore file.
 Set up a linter for HTML and CSS and make sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
 Added a descriptive README file to the project.
 Added 3 files (each one in a separate commit):
A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!".
A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header.
A test.md file with the text "This file should be ignored by git".
